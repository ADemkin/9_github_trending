# Github Trends

This script will help you to keep track of the most usefull of new repositories on a github.

It will find top 20 repositories, created less than week ago with most stars. 
Then it will print repo name, number of opened issues and url to access. More isssues mean that project is being worked on and soon will be ready for production.
